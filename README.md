# command-line-wishlist
In this excercise I'm applying all the concepts learned in the Module 1 JS Fundamentals and Module 2 Node.js Core by creating
a simple wishlist tracker with pure JavaScript and no external libraries.

### Requirements: LTS Node Version 

# How to use it

## Clone the repository in your local machine with the next command:
`git clone https://github.com/penaherrera/command-line-wishlist`

## Once cloned, navigate to the directory and run the following command:
`npm start`

## Done! Enjoy the WishList!
